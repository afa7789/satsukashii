1- get historical bitcoin data, daily, and register it some how.
    - so a bitcoin price at timestamp fetcher here.
    - it could be used elsewhere, independent of this project ( it will be a library ).
    - create a interface, and depending on the exchange/place/apikey call from there.

2- a bigmac prices consulting. ( DONE )

3- inflation array (done)

4- bitcoin calculator (DONE)

5- try to predict the price of future days, month, year as gimmick fun, just to plot a DCA.

6- use the bitcoin parts, to be able to calculate the DCA with daily,weekly,montlhy, bimontlhy, trimester, semester,yearly strategy. ( start with the first 3).
    - the starting and ending date of the strategy must make sense.
    - have to plot the amount gotten.

7 - using the inflation thing, try to calculate a % of gain above inflation, to compare with bitcoin.

8 - it would be cool to calculate the ATH fixing the dollar/or other currency, over it's inflation, to see the "real ATH".
    - get the ATH, and fix it compared to the inflation.

9 - get gold historical prices
    - gram price consulting ( convert it to KGs,ounces/quilates,or gram as the user request to see this data.)
    - add silver in the future.
